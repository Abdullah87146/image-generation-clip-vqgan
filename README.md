CLIP and VQGAN Image Generation
This repository contains Python scripts for generating images using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model for text encoding and the VQGAN (Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder) model for image synthesis. 
The scripts optimize generated images based on text prompts, utilizing cosine similarity loss for fine-tuning. This project explores the intersection of AI-driven image creation and neural network models to produce visually compelling outputs from textual descriptions.

Features
CLIP Model Integration: Utilizes the CLIP model (ViT-B/32) for encoding textual descriptions into embeddings that guide the image generation process.
VQGAN Model Utilization: Implements the VQGAN model for generating high-resolution images based on the encoded text prompts.
Optimization and Fine-tuning: Includes mechanisms for optimizing generated images to better match the semantic content of the input text using cosine similarity loss.
Python Scripts: Provides modular Python scripts that facilitate experimentation with different prompts and configurations for image generation.
